# Build Owned Order Details

Starter/shopfront-next is the incoming guided application. Completed/shopfront-next is the demonstrated checkpoint. Continue your working copy or use a separate Starter/Completed copy; never combine their build folders.

Also included: Resources.

## Run

Work in C:\react\shopfront-next: continue your own working copy there, or copy this ZIP's Starter (before) or Completed (after) project into that folder; never combine their build folders or `.next` directories. Run `npm ci`. Copy `.env.example` to a private `.env` and fill in your local PostgreSQL login and a random `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`; keep `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `SITE_URL` at `http://localhost:3000` and open the app at that exact origin. With PostgreSQL running: `npm run db:generate`, `npm run db:deploy`, then for disposable local course data only `npm run db:seed` and `npm run db:fixtures`. In separate terminals run `npm run api` (127.0.0.1:5211) and `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000). Stop anything else using ports 3000 or 5211 first.

## Build owned order details

Completed adds the guarded `/orders/[id]` detail route: the order is read through the signed-in customer's ownership relation, so another account or a signed-out visitor receives the unavailable message instead of the order. Run `npm run check`, `npm run lint` and `npm test`, then compare the same address as Alex, as Bob and signed out.
